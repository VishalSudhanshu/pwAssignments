'justify-items' and 'justify-self' are CSS properties used in the context of CSS Grid layout to control the horizontal alignment of grid items within a grid container. They work together to determine how the items are aligned within their grid cells.

Here's a breakdown of the differences between justify-items and justify-self with code examples:

1. justify-items:

    The justify-items property is applied to the grid container, and it specifies how all the grid items within the container should be horizontally aligned within their respective grid cells.

    Example:

        .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            justify-items: center; /* Horizontal alignment for all grid items */
        }

        .grid-item {
            /* The horizontal alignment of this item will be centered */
        }

2.justify-self:

    The justify-self property is applied to individual grid items, and it allows you to specify how a specific grid item should be horizontally aligned within its grid cell, overriding the alignment set by justify-items.

    Example:

        .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            justify-items: center; /* Default horizontal alignment for all grid items */
        }

        .grid-item {
            justify-self: start; /* Horizontal alignment of this item overrides the container alignment */
        }

In this example, the grid container sets justify-items to "center," which means all grid items will be horizontally centered within their respective grid cells by default. However, for a specific grid item with the class .grid-item, we override this behavior by setting justify-self to "start," which aligns that particular item to the start of its grid cell.

In summary, justify-items sets the default horizontal alignment for all grid items within a container, while justify-self allows you to individually control the horizontal alignment of specific grid items within their cells, overriding the container-level alignment.
