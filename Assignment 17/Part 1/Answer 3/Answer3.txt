Five primitive data types in JavaScript are as follows:

    Number:
        This data type represents both integers and floating-point numbers. JavaScript doesn't differentiate between the two, treating them all as numbers.

    String: 
        Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text. You can create a string by enclosing characters in single or double quotes.

    Boolean:
        Booleans have only two possible values: true or false. They are often used for logical operations and conditional statements.

    Undefined:
        When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is of type undefined. It also serves as the default return type for functions that don't explicitly return anything.

    Null:
        Null is a special value that represents the absence of any object value. It's often used to intentionally indicate that a variable or object has no value.
