Differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators:

Unary Operators:
    Definition: Unary operators operate on only one operand.
    
    Example: The unary plus + and unary minus - are common unary operators.

    Code: 
        let num = 5;
        let unaryPlus = +num;  // unaryPlus is 5
        let unaryMinus = -num; // unaryMinus is -5

Binary Operators:

    Definition: Binary operators operate on two operands.

    Example: Addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and division / are common binary operators.

    Code:   
        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;
        let sum = a + b;       // sum is 15
        let difference = a - b; // difference is 5

Ternary Operator:
    Definition: The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It's a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.

    Syntax: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

    Code:
        let age = 20;
        let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
        // If age is greater than or equal to 18, canVote is "Yes"; otherwise, it's "No"

Unary operators work on one operand (e.g., +, -, ++, --).
Binary operators work on two operands (e.g., +, -, *, /, ===, !==).
Ternary operator is the conditional operator and works on three operands (e.g., ? :).
