In programming, a loop is a statement that repeats instructions until a condition is met. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and make the code more efficient and concise.

Loops are used to: 

    Remove code redundancy

    Save time
    
    Minimize errors
    
    Reusable code
    
    Traverse data structures

Here are some types of loops: 

    For loop: Repeats a set number of times

    While loop: Repeats as long as an expression is true
    
    Do-while loop: Repeats until an expression becomes false
    
    Nested loop
    
    Foreach loop

1 For Loop:
    Syntax: 
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // Code block to be executed in each iteration
        }

    Example:
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
        }

2 While Loop:
    Syntax:
        while (condition) {
        // Code block to be executed as long as the condition is true
        }
    
    Example:
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

3 Do-While Loop:
    Syntax:
        do {
            // Code block to be executed at least once, then repeated as long as the condition is true
        } while (condition);

    Example: 
        let i = 0;
        do {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 5);
