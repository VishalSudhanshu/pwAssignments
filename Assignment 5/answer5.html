        <h1>What is Favicon</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small graphical icon or image associated with a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the web browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and browser history to provide a visual representation of the site or page. Favicon files are usually in the ICO (Icon) format but can also be in other formats like PNG or GIF.</p>

        <p><b>Illustrative Example: </b>Let's say you have a website for an online flower shop, and you want to create a favicon for your site. Here's an example:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Create a Favicon Image </dt>
            <dd>- You create a small image that represents your flower shop. It could be a simple flower icon or a stylized version of your logo.</dd>

            <dt>2. Size </dt>
            <dd>- The standard size for a favicon is 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. You create your favicon image in one of these sizes.</dd>

            <dt>3. Save as ICO </dt>
            <dd>- You save the image in ICO format (a common format for favicons). You can use image editing software or online favicon generators to do this.</dd>
            
            <dt>4. Name the File </dt>
            <dd>- You save the file as "favicon.ico."</dd>

            <dt>5. Link in HTML </dt>
            <dd>- In the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document (usually in your site's homepage), you add the following code to link to your favicon:</dd>
        </dl>

        <section>
            <p>Once you've done this, web browsers will automatically display your favicon in the browser tab when users visit your website, making it easily recognizable and helping users identify your site among their open tabs or bookmarks.</p>
