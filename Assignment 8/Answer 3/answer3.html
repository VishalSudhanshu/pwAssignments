        <h1>Solar System</h1>
        <img src="asset/orbital-plane.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The solar system is a vast and intricate celestial system that consists of the Sun, planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects bound together by gravity. It serves as our cosmic neighborhood and a source of fascination for scientists, astronomers, and enthusiasts alike. Comprising a multitude of celestial bodies, the solar system offers a window into the complexities of the universe.
            At the center of the solar system is the Sun, a star primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its immense gravitational pull holds the entire system in its grasp, providing the energy and warmth that sustains life on Earth and fuels the dynamics of the planets and other objects in the system.
            The solar system's most prominent members are the eight planets, divided into two main categories: terrestrial (inner) and gas giants (outer). The terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are relatively small, rocky bodies with solid surfaces. In contrast, the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are massive and predominantly composed of gas and liquid. Each of these planets possesses its own unique characteristics and mysteries.
            Moons, or natural satellites, orbit many of the planets in the solar system. Earth's Moon, for instance, plays a pivotal role in Earth's tides and has been a subject of human exploration for decades. Some moons, such as Europa (a moon of Jupiter) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn), are believed to harbor subsurface oceans and are prime targets for future exploration missions in the search for extraterrestrial life.
            The solar system is also home to a multitude of smaller objects, including asteroids and comets. Asteroids are rocky remnants from the early solar system and are often found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Comets, on the other hand, are icy bodies originating from the outer regions of the solar system. Their distinctive tails, which form as they approach the Sun, make them a captivating sight in the night sky.</p>
