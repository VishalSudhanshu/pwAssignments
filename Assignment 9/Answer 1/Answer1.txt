CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two popular layout models in CSS, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are the main differences between them and when to choose one over the other:

Flexbox: Designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as rows or columns. It's best for distributing space along a single axis, making it ideal for creating flexible and dynamic content within a container.
Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns. It excels at creating complex and grid-like layouts where you need precise control over both dimensions.
Axis:

Flexbox: Works along a single axis (either horizontal or vertical) at a time. You can create a row or column layout, but not both simultaneously.
Grid: Works along both the horizontal and vertical axes simultaneously, allowing you to create complex grids and layouts.
Item Order:

Flexbox: Allows for easy rearrangement of items within a single row or column without affecting other items' positions.
Grid: Provides greater control over the placement of items within rows and columns, but it's not as fluid for reordering as Flexbox.
Alignment:

Flexbox: Great for aligning items along a single axis, making it useful for centering items within a container.
Grid: Offers more advanced alignment options for both rows and columns, making it suitable for complex alignment needs.
Spacing:

Flexbox: Distributes space between items or around them along the main axis.
Grid: Provides control over the spacing between rows and columns independently, allowing for more precise control.
Use Cases:

Flexbox: Best suited for building components within a container (e.g., navigation menus, card layouts, or toolbars) or when you need to align items along a single axis.
Grid: Ideal for creating overall page layouts, complex grids (e.g., for galleries or data tables), and responsive designs where you need control over both rows and columns.
Browser Support:

Both Flexbox and Grid have good browser support in modern browsers. However, older browsers may require fallbacks or alternative layout methods.
Combining Flexbox and Grid:

It's common to use both Flexbox and Grid in a single layout. For example, you can use Grid to create the overall page structure and then use Flexbox within Grid items for fine-grained control.
